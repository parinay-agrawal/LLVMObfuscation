1. Loop_Reverse

	make Loop_Reverse
	opt -load ./Loop_Reverse.so -loop-simplify -loop-rotate -Loop_Reverse -view-cfg test.ll

2. Loop_Split

	make Loop_Split
	opt -load ./Loop_Split.so -loop-simplify -loop-rotate -splits=2 -Loop_Split -view-cfg test.ll

3. Loop_Version

	make Loop_Version
	opt -load ./Loop_Version.so -loop-simplify -loop-rotate -seed=342 -Loop_Version -view-cfg test.ll

-splits for no of splits and -seed to generate a random number
test.ll has been passed to all the 3 passes and their resulting cfg is printed.
